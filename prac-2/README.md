# CP3407 Advanced Software Engineering

## Project Overview
This repository is for the development of Tom's Trails Online, a web application to help hikers discover trails, order equipment, and plan trips. The project is inspired by Chapters 1 and 2 of "Head First Software Development," focusing on great software development practices such as iteration, customer feedback, gathering requirements via user stories, prioritization, estimation, and delivering what is needed on time and on budget.

## Refined User Stories for Practical 2
Applying Chapter 2 principles: Converted initial backlog ideas into refined user stories with titles and short descriptions. Each story is labeled with priority (High=10, Medium=20, Low=30 or higher) and estimated effort in days (refined via simulated planning poker, ensuring estimates <15 days where possible; no splits needed as all are under). Assigned to two iterations based on priorities, dependencies (e.g., login before ordering), and balanced effort (~25-30 days per iteration assuming a small team).

### Iteration 1 (Focus: Core Discovery and Access Features; Total Estimated Effort: 22 days)
1. **Title: Browse Trails**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to browse trails so that I can see available hiking options, including details like length, terrain, and highlights.  
   - Priority: High (10)  
   - Estimated Effort: 10 days  

2. **Title: Search Trails**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to search for trails by zip code and difficulty so that I can find trails near me that match my skill level, with filters for additional criteria like length.  
   - Priority: Medium (20)  
   - Estimated Effort: 3 days  

3. **Title: List Equipment**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to list equipment so that I can view available gear for purchase, including prices, descriptions, and images.  
   - Priority: High (10)  
   - Estimated Effort: 7 days  

5. **Title: User Login**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to log in so that I can access personalized features like orders and reviews.  
   - Priority: Low (30) (moved up due to dependency for Iteration 2 features)  
   - Estimated Effort: 2 days  

### Iteration 2 (Focus: Engagement and Transaction Features; Total Estimated Effort: 38 days)
4. **Title: Order Equipment**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to order equipment so that I can buy items, with handling for back-orders based on stock and integration with login for cart persistence.  
   - Priority: High (10)  
   - Estimated Effort: 15 days  

6. **Title: View Reviews**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to view reviews so that I can read feedback on trails and equipment, sorted by recency or rating.  
   - Priority: Medium (20)  
   - Estimated Effort: 3 days  

7. **Title: Add Review**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to add a review so that I can share my experiences with others, requiring login and including rating and text.  
   - Priority: Medium (20)  
   - Estimated Effort: 2 days  

9. **Title: Join Mailing List**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to join a mailing list so that I can communicate with other hikers and receive updates on new trails or deals.  
   - Priority: Medium (20)  
   - Estimated Effort: 7 days  

10. **Title: Book Trip**  
    Description: As a customer, I want to book a trip so that I can organize a guided trek, including date selection and payment.  
    - Priority: Medium (20)  
    - Estimated Effort: 10 days  

8. **Title: Compare Trails**  
   Description: As a customer, I want to compare trails so that I can decide between different options, showing side-by-side details.  
   - Priority: Low (50)  
   - Estimated Effort: 1 day
