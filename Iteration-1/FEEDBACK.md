## Emma L., Homeowner in South Bank (Busy Parent, Age 35)

### PRE

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean currently compare?**

I've used Handy a few times for quick home cleans. MyClean seems simpler and more focused on local Brisbane options, which is great since I don't want interstate cleaners.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features?**

The browsing feature is straightforward—I can see different cleaning types like standard home or deep clean easily. Search by postcode works well for finding nearby services.

**Q3: What specific areas need improvement?**

Login feels clunky; it took a couple of tries to register. Also, no mobile optimization yet—it's a bit hard on my phone. Would love filters for price or ratings.

**Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what's your current rating?**

Overall rating: 7/10

**Q5: Would you use this app as it is today?**

I'd use it only if improved. The current version has potential but needs refinement.

**Q6: Would you recommend MyClean to friends right now?**

No, not yet. I would recommend it to friends only after fixes are made.

**Q7: What is the single most critical issue blocking your regular use?**

Mobile responsiveness is the biggest blocker. I can't comfortably use it on my phone.

---

### POST

**Q1: How does the improved MyClean compare to other apps?**

Wow, the mobile version is fantastic now! It's actually better than Handy on my phone—the interface is cleaner and loads quickly. I still prefer the local Brisbane focus over Handy's broader reach.

**Q2: What improvements had the biggest impact on your experience?**

The mobile optimization has been game-changing. The responsive design makes it so easy to browse on my phone during my lunch break. Plus, the new price and rating filters are exactly what I needed to feel confident booking.

**Q3: What still needs improvement?**

The login process is much smoother now, but it would be nice to have single sign-on with Google or Facebook. Also, a "favorites" feature to save my preferred cleaners would be helpful.

**Q4: What's your rating now?**

Overall rating: 9/10

**Q5: Would you use MyClean regularly?**

Absolutely! I've already booked two cleanings this month and plan to use it for my regular bi-weekly cleans going forward.

**Q6: Would you recommend it now?**

Yes, definitely! I've already recommended it to three friends in my mothers group, and they're all downloading it.

**Q7: What would make you a loyal, long-term user?**

If you could add a loyalty rewards program or discounts for regular customers, I'd be a customer for life. Maybe points toward free cleans after a certain number of bookings?

## Raj P., Office Worker in CBD (Professional, Age 42)

### PRE

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean compare?**

TaskRabbit is my go-to, but it's overwhelming with too many categories. MyClean is more streamlined for cleaning specifically, which suits Brisbane's humid weather needs.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features?**

Search functionality is quick; I like how it pulls up options by suburb. Login integrates well for saving preferences.

**Q3: What areas need improvement?**

Lacks integration with calendars for booking slots. Also, no reviews visible yet, so hard to trust providers. UI could use more colors to make it engaging.

**Q4: What's your current rating?**

Overall rating: 6/10

**Q5: Would you use this app today?**

Not really. Potential is there, but I need more features before switching from TaskRabbit.

**Q6: Would you recommend it to friends?**

No, not yet. I'd wait for the reviews and calendar features first.

**Q7: What's the most critical missing feature?**

Provider reviews are critical. Without them, I can't confidently book a cleaner I don't know.

---

### POST

**Q1: How does the improved MyClean compare now?**

The new review system has completely changed my perception. I can now see actual ratings and customer feedback, which gives me confidence. MyClean is actually becoming my preferred option over TaskRabbit for cleaning specifically—it's less cluttered and more trustworthy.

**Q2: What made the biggest difference?**

The calendar integration is brilliant! I can now book directly into my work schedule without having to go back and forth between apps. The provider reviews with photos and detailed comments have been huge for building trust in the cleaners.

**Q3: Any remaining issues?**

The UI is much more colorful now—much better! One thing missing is the ability to see provider availability in real-time. Also, I'd appreciate an option to book recurring cleanings with fixed scheduling.

**Q4: Rating now?**

Overall rating: 8.5/10

**Q5: Using it regularly?**

Yes, I've started using it as my primary cleaning service app. I've switched from TaskRabbit for cleaning services specifically.

**Q6: Recommending it?**

Absolutely! I've told several colleagues in the CBD, and two have already signed up.

**Q7: What would make you switch completely?**

If MyClean added other services like handyman work or plumbing, I'd use it exclusively. But for cleaning, it's now my go-to app.

## Sophie M., Freelance Cleaner in New Farm (Service Provider, Age 28)

### PRE

**Q1: Have you used similar apps as a provider before?**

I've signed up on Handy as a provider. MyClean's login for pros is basic but easy to set up profiles—better for local gigs in Brisbane communities.

**Q2: What features work well?**

Browsing shows clear service categories, and search helps match my skills to jobs nearby. Feels community-focused.

**Q3: What needs to change?**

No way to upload photos of my work or see job requests yet. Dashboard after login is minimal; needs better tools for managing availability.

**Q4: Your rating?**

Overall rating: 8/10

**Q5: Would you use it today?**

Yes, I'd use it to connect with Brisbane customers.

**Q6: Recommend to other cleaners?**

Yes, I'd recommend it to other cleaners in Brisbane for its simplicity.

**Q7: What provider feature matters most?**

A portfolio section to upload before-and-after photos and a better availability dashboard are essential.

---

### POST

**Q1: How's your experience now as a provider?**

Massively improved! The portfolio feature has been transformative. I've uploaded 12 before-and-after photos from my best jobs, and I've noticed customers are more likely to hire me. The new provider dashboard is so much cleaner and easier to navigate.

**Q2: What changed your booking success?**

The photo portfolio is the game-changer. Customers can see my work quality immediately, which has led to more bookings. The improved availability calendar means I can manage my schedule without double-booking myself. I've gotten 15 new job inquiries in the last month alone.

**Q3: What's still missing?**

I'd love a messaging system to communicate directly with customers before confirming jobs. Also, an automated payment system would be helpful—currently payment coordination is a bit manual.

**Q4: Rating now?**

Overall rating: 9.5/10

**Q5: Primary platform yet?**

Definitely! I'm now getting more jobs through MyClean than Handy. I'm actually considering dropping Handy altogether and making MyClean my primary platform.

**Q6: Recommending more?**

Yes, 100%! I've already referred three other cleaners I know in Brisbane, and they're all setting up profiles.

**Q7: What would make it exclusive for you?**

If you added direct payment processing and a built-in messaging system, I wouldn't need any other platform. That's really all that's missing.

## Liam T., Retiree in Paddington (Homeowner, Age 65)

### PRE

**Q1: Used apps like this before?**

Never used apps like this; I usually call local services. MyClean is a good intro—simple enough for non-tech-savvy folks like me in older Brisbane suburbs.

**Q2: What works well?**

The browse section lists services clearly, like window cleaning which I need often. Search by difficulty (e.g., light vs. heavy clean) is helpful.

**Q3: What needs fixing?**

Text is a bit small, hard to read without zooming. No accessibility options like voice search. Would like emergency booking for quick cleans.

**Q4: Your rating?**

Overall rating: 5/10

**Q5: Would you use it today?**

It's okay, but only with assistance. I'd need it to be more user-friendly.

**Q6: Recommend to seniors?**

No, not to other seniors yet. Accessibility needs to improve first.

**Q7: Most important accessibility fix?**

Larger font sizes are critical—I can barely read the current text without magnifying.

---

### POST

**Q1: Is it easier to use now?**

Oh yes, much better! The new font size options are wonderful. I've set it to the largest size, and I can read everything clearly without needing my magnifying glass. The high-contrast mode is also nice and easy on the eyes.

**Q2: What made the biggest difference?**

The larger fonts are the main thing. I can actually read everything now. The voice search feature is also fantastic—I just say "window cleaning" and it finds the service for me. That's brilliant! I feel much more confident using it now.

**Q3: Any remaining challenges?**

Not really any major ones now. Maybe the buttons could be a tiny bit larger for easier tapping, but overall it's very accessible. The emergency booking feature is great—I used it last week to get a quick carpet clean.

**Q4: Rating now?**

Overall rating: 8/10

**Q5: Using it independently?**

Yes, absolutely! I'm using it completely independently now. My daughter is amazed I'm managing it on my own.

**Q6: Recommending to other seniors?**

Yes, definitely! I've mentioned it to several mates at the bowls club. Two of them have already asked their grandchildren to help them set it up.

**Q7: Completely comfortable now?**

I think we're pretty much there now. Maybe a phone support line for troubleshooting would be nice for other seniors, but I'm comfortable. You've done a really good job making this work for people like me.

## Aisha K., Student in West End (Shared Housing Resident, Age 22)

### PRE

**Q1: Used other cleaning apps?**

Used TaskRabbit for end-of-lease cleans. MyClean feels more affordable and Brisbane-centric, which is perfect for student budgets.

**Q2: What do you like?**

Login is quick with email, and browsing shows eco-friendly options that align with West End's green community vibe.

**Q3: What needs work?**

Search could include filters for budget or eco-certifications. App loads slowly sometimes, and no dark mode for night use.

**Q4: Current rating?**

Overall rating: 7/10

**Q5: Would you use it?**

Yes, I'd use it for group house cleans.

**Q6: Recommend to friends?**

Yes, I'd recommend it to uni friends in shared housing.

**Q7: Perfect feature for you?**

Dark mode and eco-certification filters would be ideal, plus the ability to split payments between roommates.

---

### POST

**Q1: How's it improved?**

It's so much smoother now! The dark mode is perfect for late-night browsing, and the app loads instantly instead of hanging. The eco-certification filters are exactly what I was hoping for—it aligns with our house's values.

**Q2: Biggest impact on your group?**

The group payment splitting feature is incredible! We can now book a cleaning with five roommates and each pay exactly our share through the app. It's saved us so much time and awkward conversations about who owes what. The eco-friendly filters mean we're always booking sustainable services.

**Q3: Still room for improvement?**

The performance is night and day compared to before. Dark mode makes it way more enjoyable to use in the evening. The whole experience feels polished and modern. One thing would be recurring booking automation.

**Q4: Rating now?**

Overall rating: 9/10

**Q5: How often using it?**

Absolutely! We've gone from booking maybe once a semester to now booking monthly. The split payment feature has made it so easy that we're maintaining a cleaner house throughout the year.

**Q6: Recommending more?**

Yes! I'm basically the MyClean ambassador in my uni group now. I've sent the link to like 20 people in various shared houses. Three different house groups have already started using it regularly.

**Q7: What's the final piece?**

Honestly, it's already pretty much there! If you could add recurring booking automation—like "book the same cleaner every third Saturday"—that would be the icing on the cake.
