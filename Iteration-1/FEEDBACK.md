# MyClean App - User Feedback Report
## Post-Iteration 1 - Brisbane User Testing

---

## Interview 1: Emma L., Homeowner in South Bank (Busy Parent, Age 35)

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean compare?**

I've used Handy a few times for quick home cleans. MyClean seems simpler and more focused on local Brisbane options, which is great since I don't want interstate cleaners.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features (e.g., browsing, searching, login)?**

The browsing feature is straightforward—I can see different cleaning types like standard home or deep clean easily. Search by postcode works well for finding nearby services.

**Q3: What specific areas need improvement, and why?**

Login feels clunky; it took a couple of tries to register. Also, no mobile optimization yet—it's a bit hard on my phone. Would love filters for price or ratings.

**Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what's your overall rating of the app?**

Overall rating: 7/10

**Q5: Would you use this app in the future?**

I'd use it if improved, but the current version needs some refinement before I'd fully commit.

**Q6: Would you recommend MyClean to friends or family?**

I would recommend it to friends only after the improvements mentioned above are implemented.

**Q7: What single feature would make the biggest difference to your experience?**

Mobile responsiveness would be the biggest game-changer for me, followed closely by adding price and rating filters.

## Interview 2: Raj P., Office Worker in CBD (Professional, Age 42)

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean compare?**

TaskRabbit is my go-to, but it's overwhelming with too many categories. MyClean is more streamlined for cleaning specifically, which suits Brisbane's humid weather needs.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features (e.g., browsing, searching, login)?**

Search functionality is quick; I like how it pulls up options by suburb. Login integrates well for saving preferences.

**Q3: What specific areas need improvement, and why?**

Lacks integration with calendars for booking slots. Also, no reviews visible yet, so hard to trust providers. UI could use more colors to make it engaging.

**Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what's your overall rating of the app?**

Overall rating: 6/10

**Q5: Would you use this app in the future?**

Potential is there, but I need more features before I'd switch from TaskRabbit permanently.

**Q6: Would you recommend MyClean to friends or family?**

Not yet—I'd wait for the reviews and calendar booking features to be added before recommending it.

**Q7: What is the most critical missing feature for you?**

Provider reviews are critical for building trust. Without them, I can't confidently book a cleaner I don't know.

## Interview 3: Sophie M., Freelance Cleaner in New Farm (Service Provider, Age 28)

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean compare?**

I've signed up on Handy as a provider. MyClean's login for pros is basic but easy to set up profiles—better for local gigs in Brisbane communities.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features (e.g., browsing, searching, login)?**

Browsing shows clear service categories, and search helps match my skills to jobs nearby. Feels community-focused.

**Q3: What specific areas need improvement, and why?**

No way to upload photos of my work or see job requests yet. Dashboard after login is minimal; needs better tools for managing availability.

**Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what's your overall rating of the app?**

Overall rating: 8/10

**Q5: Would you use this app in the future?**

Absolutely—I'd use it as a provider to connect with more Brisbane customers.

**Q6: Would you recommend MyClean to friends or family?**

Yes, I'd recommend it to other cleaners in Brisbane for its simplicity and local focus.

**Q7: What provider features would help you most to succeed on the platform?**

A portfolio section for uploading before-and-after photos and a better availability management dashboard would make it easy for customers to see my work quality.

## Interview 4: Liam T., Retiree in Paddington (Homeowner, Age 65)

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean compare?**

Never used apps like this; I usually call local services. MyClean is a good intro—simple enough for non-tech-savvy folks like me in older Brisbane suburbs.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features (e.g., browsing, searching, login)?**

The browse section lists services clearly, like window cleaning which I need often. Search by difficulty (e.g., light vs. heavy clean) is helpful.

**Q3: What specific areas need improvement, and why?**

Text is a bit small, hard to read without zooming. No accessibility options like voice search. Would like emergency booking for quick cleans.

**Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what's your overall rating of the app?**

Overall rating: 5/10

**Q5: Would you use this app in the future?**

It's okay, but it needs to be more user-friendly before I'd use it regularly without assistance.

**Q6: Would you recommend MyClean to friends or family?**

Not to other seniors yet—accessibility needs to improve first. Maybe to younger family members.

**Q7: What accessibility feature would make the app easier for you to use?**

Larger font sizes and a high-contrast mode would make the biggest difference in my ability to use the app comfortably.

## Interview 5: Aisha K., Student in West End (Shared Housing Resident, Age 22)

**Q1: Have you used similar cleaning booking apps before, and how does MyClean compare?**

Used TaskRabbit for end-of-lease cleans. MyClean feels more affordable and Brisbane-centric, which is perfect for student budgets.

**Q2: What do you like most about the app's current features (e.g., browsing, searching, login)?**

Login is quick with email, and browsing shows eco-friendly options that align with West End's green community vibe.

**Q3: What specific areas need improvement, and why?**

Search could include filters for budget or eco-certifications. App loads slowly sometimes, and no dark mode for night use.

**Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what's your overall rating of the app?**

Overall rating: 7/10

**Q5: Would you use this app in the future?**

Yes, I'd use it for group house cleans regularly.

**Q6: Would you recommend MyClean to friends or family?**

Definitely—I'd recommend it to uni friends, especially those in shared housing.

**Q7: What feature would make the app perfect for your group living situation?**

An eco-certification filter and dark mode would be ideal, plus the ability to split payments between roommates would be game-changing.
