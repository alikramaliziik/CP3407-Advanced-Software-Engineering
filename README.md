## Project Overview
This repository is for the CP3407 Advanced Software Engineering project. The goal is to develop an online platform for trail guides and equipment sales ). We will apply iterative development: gathering requirements as features, prioritizing them (10 = high, 50 = low), estimating effort in days, and planning iterations of ~20 working days.

## Project Setup

 Applying Chapter 1: Focus on delivering what is needed, on time (3-month deadline), and on budget through iteration and customer feedback.

## Initial Backlog Ideas
Rough user stories (features) with priorities:

1. **As a customer, I want to browse trails by location so that I can find hikes near me.**  
   Priority: 10 (High - Core feature for user engagement).  

2. **As a customer, I want to search for trails by difficulty and zip code so that I can match my skill level.**  
   Priority: 20 (Medium - Builds on browsing).  

3. **As a customer, I want to view equipment listings so that I can see available products.**  
   Priority: 10 (High - Drives sales).  

4. **As a logged-in customer, I want to buy equipment so that I can place orders.**  
   Priority: 10 (High - Key revenue feature; depends on login).  

5. **As a customer, I want to log in with email/password so that I can access personalized features.**  
   Priority: 30 (Medium - Required for buying but lower than core browsing/sales).  

6. **As a customer, I want to view reviews for trails so that I can learn from others' experiences.**  
   Priority: 20 (Medium - Enhances decision-making).  

7. **As a logged-in customer, I want to add a review for a trail so that I can share my feedback.**  
   Priority: 20 (Medium - Encourages community).  

8. **As a customer, I want to compare trails side-by-side so that I can choose the best one.**  
   Priority: 50 (Low - Nice-to-have after basics).  

9. **As a customer, I want to join a mailing list so that I can receive updates.**  
   Priority: 20 (Medium - For customer retention).  

10. **As a logged-in customer, I want to post to a mailing list or forum so that I can communicate with others.**  
    Priority: 20 (Medium - Builds community).

These are rough ideas; estimates (in days) and iterations will be added in future planning.
