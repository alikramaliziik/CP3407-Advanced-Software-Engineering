# CP3407 Advanced Software Engineering

## Project Overview
This repository is for the development of Tom's Trails Online, a web application to help hikers discover trails, order equipment, and plan trips. The project is inspired by Chapter 1 of "Head First Software Development," focusing on great software development practices such as iteration, customer feedback, and delivering what is needed on time and on budget.
